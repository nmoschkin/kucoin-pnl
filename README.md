# KuCoin Futures PNL Calculator

A simple Profit-and-Loss calculator that uses the exported __PNL History.csv__ files from KuCoin Futures written in Windws Forms (.NET Core 5.0).

You can load as many PNL History files as you want, and it will skip duplicates.

When you clone the project, be sure to run __git submodule init__ and __git submodule update__ from the root project directory.

After you choose your files, just click __Load__ and then click __Calculate PNL__.  Doing anything else will probably cause an exception, right now.
